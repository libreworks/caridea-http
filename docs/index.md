# caridea/http

üç§ Caridea is a miniscule PHP application library. This shrimpy fellow is what you'd use when you just want some helping hands and not a full-blown framework.

This is its HTTP component. It includes small utilities for working with [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) HTTP requests and responses.

* [HTTP Accept header utility](01-accept.md)
* [Controller helper traits](02-traits.md)
* [URI related utilities](03-uri.md)
* [RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs](04-problem-details.md)
