# caridea-http
Caridea is a miniscule PHP web application library. This shrimpy fellow is what you'd use when you just want some helping hands and not a full-blown framework.

This is its HTTP component. It includes small utilities for working with PSR-7 HTTP requests and responses, including:

* An implementation of "[Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-http-problem-00)".
